# brian's Standard Configuration for Perl 5 Modules on AppVeyor

[AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) is a continuous integration service for Windows and Linux. I test my [public Perl modules](https://github.com/briandfoy) on it and they often have the same configuration. I created this repository to version a file that show up in most of my repositories.

I have similar repostories:

* [Travis CI for Perl 5](https://github.com/briandfoy/brians_perl_modules_travis_config)
* [Travis CI for Perl 6](https://github.com/briandfoy/brians_perl6_modules_travis_config)
* [AppVeyor for Perl 6 Modules](https://github.com/briandfoy/brians_perl6_modules_appveyor_config)


And sometimes I write about these things:
