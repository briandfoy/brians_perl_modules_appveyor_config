# Contributing to this project

This project is a default configuration file for my personal projects. I'm not trying to make a configuration file that satisfies everyone situation.

If you have some good ideas I'd like to hear about them. I might like them for all of my projects. I might also think it's not something for me. I'm likely to test this with a couple of modules and slowly deploy them to more modules as I'm confident that it works.

All of this stuff is licensed under the [Artistic License 2.0](LICENSE). If your features diverge from what I like you can take everything you find here and develop it in your direction.
